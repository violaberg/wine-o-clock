# **Agile Methodology**

## **Overview**

This project was created using Agile Methodology to split it in smaller tasks. To do so, I created user stories with acceptance criteria and grouped these into EPIC milestones so I can focus on one feature at the time.

### **EPIC**

In Agile tasks/user stories can be broken down into EPICS or Milestones. It's a helpful way to segment user stories based on needs/requests of end-users while working towards a fully functional project.<br>

I edited due dates few times as I learned in proccess how long time certain tasks take or for example, realized I had my fonts chosen but needed few more days to see how it actually looks, as sometimes when all is added together, changes are needed.

### **USER STORIES**

A user story serves as an explanation how a certain feature will provide a value to a user. The help developer to understand what and why they are building to provide a better end product overall.

### **MoSCoW METHOD**

A MoSCoW Method is a popular prioritization technique used in many projects, not only software development. It uses a 4-step approach of "must-have", "should-have", "could-have" and "won't-have".

### **GITHUB KANBAN BOARD**

Kanban board is one way how to provide a visual for project management, optimize workflow and increase efficiency. As it is my first time fully implementing Kanban board, ups and downs and some inaccuracy was expected.

## **Conclusion**

 Using Agile was new to me, it was messy as with many things first time trying but a good way to learn and see how anything works is to try it in action. I had to edit due dates few times as I wasn't sure how long tasks take to complete, I forgot to close issues as I got very unwell during start of the project unfortunately and thought of many different ways I could have done user stories. For example, I created user stories and then epics but later realized I should have created epics and then user stories.<br>
 Overall it was a great experience and kept me on track most of the time, as well as helped to understand how much is left to do as at times project felt never ending.
